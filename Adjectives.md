<h1 style="text-align:center">Adjectives</h1>

In Arabic, the noun comes first in the sentence and the adjective comes second. Furthermore, adjectives must have the same characteristics (Definiteness, Gender, Number) as the noun.

This means that:
- if the noun is masculine, the adjective must be masculine, 
- if the noun is femanine, the adjective must be feminine,
- if the noun is definite, the adjective must be definite,
- if the noun is plural, the adjective must be plural.

## 'Big House' Structure
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;">بيت كبير</p>

## 'The Big House' Structure


<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;"><span style="color: green;">ال</span>بيت <span style="color: green;">ال</span>كبير</p>

## 'The House is Big' Structure
When the noun and the adjective do not agree on definiteness, that is, when the noun is definite and the adjective is not, then the adjective does **not** modify the noun.

Instead, the adjective and noun form a clause of 'The X is Y'.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;"><span style="color: red;">ال</span>بيت كبير</p>

In the above example (big), the adjective is definite (highlighed by the red ال) and the noun (house) is not. Therefore the adjective is not modifying the noun and it instead reads "the house is big".
