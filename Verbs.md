<h1 style="text-align:center">Verbs</h1>

Tenses in Arabic are divided into three main types:
- Past
- Present
- Future

Present tense verbs always begin with one of the letters: ا (Alif), ت (Taa), ي (Ya), or ن (Nun).

## Present Tense Verbs

| Pronoun  | Prefix | Suffix | Example (read) | Translit.      |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| I        | a-     | _N/A_  | أقرا           | **a**qra       |
| You (m)* | t-     | _N/A_  | تقرا           | **ta**qra      |
| You (f)  | t-     | -y     | تقرئي          | **ta**qra**y** |
| You (pl) | t-     | -w     |                |                | 
| He       | y-     | _N/A_  | يقرأ           | **ya**qra      |
| She*     | t-     | _N/A_  | تقرا           | **ta**qra      |
| We       | na-    | _N/A_  | نقرأ           | **na**qra      |
| They     | y-     | -w     |                |                |

\* Notice how 'She' and  'You (m)' share the same prefix and lack of suffix. While it's possible to omit the pronouns in most cases when speaking in Arabic, when talking about 'She' or 'You (m)', it's best to add the pronoun to avoid ambiguity.

### Rule: Verbs ending with ي
When the verb ends with ي and required conjugation is either 'They' or 'You (pl)', then the ي must be dropped before conjugation. 

### Continuous Actions
For a present tense verb to be 'currently' happening, much like the English 'ing' endings (reading, writing, watching, etc.) then a special article 'عم' must be added before the verb.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;">أنا <span style="color: green;">عم</span> أقرا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am reading</p>

## Future Tense Verbs

For a verb to be happening in the future, a special article 'راح' must be added before the conjugated present tense verb.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;">أنا <span style="color: green;">راح</span> أقرا</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I will read</p>

## Past Tense Verbs

| Pronoun  | Prefix | Suffix | Example | Translit. |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| I        | _N/A_  | -t     |         |           |
| You (m)  | _N/A_  | -t     |         |           |
| You (f)  | _N/A_  | -ti    |         |           |
| You (pl) | _N/A_  | -tu    |         |           |
| He       | _N/A_  | _N/A_  |         |           |
| She      | _N/A_  | -et    |         |           |
| We       | _N/A_  | -na    |         |           |
| They     | _N/A_  | -u     |         |           |


### Rule: Verbs with و in the middle
When the verb has و in the middle and the required conjugation is either 'He', 'She', or 'They', then the و is changed for ا. 
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;">
	أر<span style="color: green;">و</span>ح
	🡢ر<span style="color: green;">ا</span>ح
</p>
