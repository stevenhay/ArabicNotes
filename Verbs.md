Tenses in Arabic are divided into three main types:
- Past
- Present
- Future

Present tense verbs always begin with one of the letters: ا (Alif), ت (Taa), ي (Ya), or ن (Nun).

## Present Tense Verbs

| Pronoun  | Prefix | Suffix | Example (read) | Translit.      |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| I        | a-     | _N/A_  | أقرا           | **a**qra       |
| You (m)*  | t-     | _N/A_  | تقرا           | **ta**qra      |
| You (f)  | t-     | -y     | تقرئي          | **ta**qra**y** |
| You (pl) | t-     | -w     |                |                |
| He       | y-     | _N/A_  | يقرأ           | **ya**qra      |
| She*     | t-     | _N/A_  | تقرا           | **ta**qra      |
| We       | na-    | _N/A_  | نقرأ           | **na**qra      | 
| They     | y-     | -w     |                |                |
