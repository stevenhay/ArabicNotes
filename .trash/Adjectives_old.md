## 'The House is Big' Structure
When the noun and the adjective do not agree on definiteness, that is, when the noun is definite and the adjective is not, then the adjective does **not** modify the noun.

Instead, the adjective and noun form a clause of 'The X is Y'.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2.1em;"><span style="color: red;">ال</span>بيت كبير</p>

In the above example (big), the adjective is definite (highlighed by the red ال) and the noun (house) is not. Therefore the adjective is not modifying the noun and it instead reads "the house is big".
