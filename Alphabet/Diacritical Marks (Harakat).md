The **fatḥah** is a small diagonal line placed _above_ a letter, and represents a short /a/ (like the /a/ sound in English word "cat"). The word __fatḥah__ itself means _opening_ and refers to the opening of the mouth when producing an /a/.

When a **_fatḥah_** is placed before a plain letter ⟨ا⟩ (i.e. one having no hamza or vowel of its own), it represents a long /aː/ (close to the sound of "a" in the English word "dad", with an open front vowel /æː/, not back /ɑː/ as in "father").

When a fathah placed before the letter ⟨ﻱ⟩ (yā’), it creates an /aj/ (as in "l**ie**"); and when placed before the letter ⟨و⟩ (wāw), it creates an /aw/ (as in "c**ow**").

A similar diagonal line _below_ a letter is called a **_kasrah_** and designates a short /i/ (as in "me", "be") and its allophones [i, ɪ, e, e̞, ɛ] (as in "Tim", "sit").

When a __kasrah__ is placed before a plain letter ⟨ﻱ⟩, it represents a long /iː/ (as in the English word "steed").

The **_ḍammah_** is a small curl-like diacritic placed above a letter to represent a short /u/ (as in "duke", shorter "you") and its allophones [u, ʊ, o, o̞, ɔ] (as in "put", or "bull").

The **_sukūn_** is a circle-shaped diacritic placed above a letter. It indicates that the consonant to which it is attached is not followed by a vowel.

It is a necessary symbol for writing consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, which are very common in Arabic. For example: ⟨دَدْ⟩ (__dad__).

The **shadda** or **shaddah** is a diacritic shaped like a small written Latin "w". 

It is used to indicate [gemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) (consonant doubling or extra length), which is phonemic in Arabic. It is written above the consonant which is to be doubled. It is the only __ḥarakah__ that is commonly used in ordinary spelling to avoid ambiguity
